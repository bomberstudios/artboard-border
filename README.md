# Artboard Border

This plugin adds a border around the Artboards in the current page. Useful if you want to export a single page PDF with all your Artboards and need them to have a border.

There are two commands: Add Border, and Remove Border, which are pretty self explanatory.

## Installation

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-border/releases/latest/download/artboard-border.sketchplugin.zip), unzip it and double click on the .sketchplugin file.

## Possible Improvements

- Add a Shared Style to the document (or use one if it's already there) to make it easier to change the colour of the border
- Custom settings (at the moment it adds a pretty boring #969696 border)
